This site summarizes my research. You can find a selected list of research highlights under Publications. A list of ongoing projects is in the Projects page. Interesting press reports about our work is under Press. A complete list of publications can be found in my Google Scholar and ResearchGate sites. 

Out side of work, I enjoy learning new topics, ski, golf and other sports, arts, and investing.

Research Interest
======
I study climate/weather physics and engineering. Both physical and machine learning models are extensively used in my work. Data sources include satellite remote sensing, physical model outputs, and various other measurements.

Educations
======
1. Geophysics and Computer Science double major, Bachelor, Peking University, 2001
2. Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, PhD, University of Maryland, 2008

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
